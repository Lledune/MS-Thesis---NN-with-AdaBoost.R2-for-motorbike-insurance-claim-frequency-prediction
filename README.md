# Poisson-neural-network-insurance-pricing

Master Thesis by Lucien Ledune, with distinction.

Trying to apply AdaBoost technique combined with neural networks in an insurance setting. (custom loss function)
The goal is to predict the claim frequency of a motorbike insurance clients (benchmarked against GLMs which are the currently most used technique for that purpose).
Claim frequency is the ratio representing the number of accidents divided by the duration of the contract (aka number of accidents per year)

Most of the code is inside the Python folder, it contains the code for shallow neural networks, deep neural networks, and hand-coded AdaBoost.R2 class (no packages).
It also contains a fully detailed 60+ pages report in the Lyx folder. This report is written in FRENCH.
